# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

Working through and expanding upon examples from 'Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On' by Maxim Lapan

* 00_xbvf_cartpole_testing: Script to test video recording of agent's behavior.

* 01_Atari_image_GAN: Generator learn how to create authentic Atari screenshots in ~50,000 iterations

* 02_cartpole_cross_entropy: Uses crossentropy RL method to teach the agent to balance a pole

* 03_frozen_lake_entropy: Navigating a slippery maze using cross-entropy
